###Stacks and Queues are data structures. These data structures consist of Nodes. 

####Terminology for Stacks:

* Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
* Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* Top - This is the top of the stack.
* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

###Stacks are also first in and last out meaning when you add new nodes to a stack they are put to the front of the stack. 

###Queues are similar to stacks but they are first in and first out like a line at a grocery store. Or as the british call it a Queue which is perfect.

####Terminology for Queues: 

* Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
* Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
* Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
