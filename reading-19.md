## Reading 19 Claims

The difference between Authentication and Authorization is that Authentication is a test to determine whether you are who you say you are versus, Authorization which is what sort of permissions do you have based on who you are. 

Claims based authentication means that depending on your authentication you will have certain claims to be able to perform certain actions. Through having certain information through the authentication you will gain claim to different actions.

Lacking certain information that is valid will cause you to be rejected from that claim. 

This is like having a driver's license to enter a bar but not an employee id to enter the backrooms. Roles and Tokens are another part of the authentication and authorization process.
