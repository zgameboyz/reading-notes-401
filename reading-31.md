## Reading 31 Razor Pages

Razor pages are easier to use for smaller but still multipage web applications. They allow you to keep the Controllers, Services, and Views all in the same folder which helps to organize and store them in an easy to read fashion. 

So there are actually no folders for the views and controllers because the Folder called Pages is the one that actually holds all of the different pages and their cooresponding pieces. 

The razor markup language uses the @ symbol to start and end a C# code block.
