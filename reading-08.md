Collections are groups of related objects that you create. There are two ways to group objects. The first is by creating an array of objects and the second is by creating a collection of objects. Arrays are useful when working with a fixed number of strongly typed objects.

Collections provide a more flexible way to work with a groups of objects. (microsoft docs)

A collection is a class and an instance must be declared of that class before you can add elements to the collection.

If the collection only contains one data type you can use one of the classes in the System.Collections.Generic namespace.

Enumeration types are a value type defined by a set of named constants of the underlying intergal numeric type.
