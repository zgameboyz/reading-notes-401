## Reading 38 React 2

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use Javascript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

Variables can be used to store elements This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn't change.

Keys are used in react to identity which items, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys.
