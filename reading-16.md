### DTOs 

This reading is focused on creating DTO's This stands for Data Transfer Objects.

A DTO is an object that defines how data will be sent over the network. This is useful to make sure you do not send things you do not want to be sent over the network. 
It also makes the data you send much smaller in terms of perhaps properties of a class. You use LINQ Select statement to convert entities into DTO's.
