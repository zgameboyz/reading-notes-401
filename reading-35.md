## Reading 35 Graphs

Graphs are a Data Structure that is used to show linkage between Nodes or Vertex. They are connected with lines called edges. The adjacent nodes are then referred to as Neighbors(if connected by a node).

The Degree of a vertex is the number of nodes it is connected to by Edges.

Unidirectional edges means that you can point to a specific node with an edge but you cannot go the reverse direction. 

Bilateral or undirected edges have the ability to go both ways.

A complete graph is when all of the Vertexes are connected to eachother in the graph. A connected Graph is when all of the nodes have at least 1 connection in the graph. A disconnected Graph can have segments of vertexes outside of the main graph or singular nodes even.
