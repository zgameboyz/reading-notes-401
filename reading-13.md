Asp.Net core supports dependency injections. This is a technque for achieving inversion of control between classes and their dependencies.
A dependency is an object that another object depends on. You can create an instance of a class that uses the methods of the class that is being depended upon. Dependency injection uses an interface or base class to abstract the dependency implementation. The framework will create an instance of a class then dispose of it when it is no longer needed.
