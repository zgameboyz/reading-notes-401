## Reading 06

The reading focuses on 3 main principles of OOP(object oriented programming). There is Inheritance, Abstract, and Polymorphism.

Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes. Classes can be derived from other classes. These classes are called derived classes. A derived class can only have one direct base class. The derivation of classes are transient meaning that if a parent class passes its inheritance to its child then that child's children will also have the same derived characteristics as their parents.

A secondary derived class is usually a special case of the parent class like a type of car from the parent Car class from the base class of automobiles. 

The Abstract keyword enables you to create classes and class members that are incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class. The sealed keyword allows you to prevent the inheritance of previously marked virtual classes. (From Microsoft Docs)

Polymorphism, in C#, is the ability of objects of different types to provide a unique interface for different implementations of methods. (from techopedia.com)
