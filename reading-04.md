## Code Reading 4

This reading consists of  classes and objects.

A Class is like a blueprint in creating an object where an object is a instance of a class. Basically, it is like creating a object based off a set of instructions. 
The properties of a class are what make up the object like wheels on a car. 

Objects are created using constructors and this allows you to make many different objects of a certain created class. 

Objects are nice as modern programming languages are all about utilizing and manipulating objects.
