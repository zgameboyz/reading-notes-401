## Reading 12

This reading focuses heavily on how to create a MVC (Model View Controller) web application. 

The focus goes through each area of creating a MVC app. You must create a model for your database, and you must create entities. Then afterwards you have to actually create the database model functionality by making a database context.

There seems to be a way to change the contents of a database without having to delete and recreate it using Code First Migrations. This seems useful.

After all that good stuff you must now create the controllers and the views. Visual studio scaffolding helps to create the CRUD action methods automatically.
