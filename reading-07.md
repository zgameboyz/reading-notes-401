Interfaces are groups of related functionalities that a non-abstract class or a struct must implement. An interface is basically a directive that must be followed when implemented into a class. You can include behaviors from mulitple classes. In addition you must use an interface if you want to simulate inheritance from structs. (Microsoft Docs)

It is popular convention to name Interfaces with a capital I. An example would be ICar. Interfaces can contain instance methods, properties,events, indexers, or any combination of the four. 

The interface member must be public and non static and have the same name and signature as the interface member. Also interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.

The benefit of interfaces is to allow classes to utilize the methods in the interface and in turn become more broad. They do not have to have a specific method to handle many specific actions of more specific classes. 

Interfaces are always implemented by more than one class or there is no point.
