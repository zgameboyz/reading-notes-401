Trees include 3 in our learning. There are more trees but we are focused on three types. The first is the Binary tree, Then we have the Binary Search Trees, Lastly is the K-ary tree.

A Binary tree is a tree in which the children on from the root of the tree can have 1 or 2 children maximum. 

The next tree a binary search tree may have the same amount as a regular binary tree with the caveat of the nodes follow a structure. The nodes to the left of a parent node must be smaller than the parent. The nodes to the right will be larger and any node of the same size is disregarded. 

The K-ary tree is less structured than both trees and allows you to have any given amount of child nodes or even none. 

There are 2 main traversals such as Depth first and Breadth first. 

Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth o0f the tree first. THere are multiple ways to carry out this type of traversal as stated below.
```
Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root
```

Then there is breadth traversal in which you will traverse the tree from left to right and by row.
