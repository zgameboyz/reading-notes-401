## Reading 34 Xamarin

Xamarin is an open-source platform for building modern and performant applications for iOS, Android, and Windows with .NET. 

Xamarin enables developers to share an average of 90% of their application across platforms. This pattern allows developers to write all of their business logic in a single language (or reuse existing application code) but achieve native performance, look, and feel on each platform.

Xamarin applications can be written on PC or Mac and compile into native application packages, such as an .apk file on Android, or an .ipa file on iOS.
