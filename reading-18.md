## Reading 18 Identity

Identity is a membership system that adds login functionality to ASP.NET core applications. Identity can be configured using a SQL Server database to store user names, passwords, and profile data. Alternatively, another persistent store can be used, for example, Azure Table Storage.

There is a lot of setup required to get Identity working with Visual studio. The simplified need things are a Log in, Log Out, A Register, and you may have a Test Identity. 

You may set your minimum password requirements on a page as well.
