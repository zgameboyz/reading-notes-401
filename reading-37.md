## Reading 37 React 1

React is a JavaScript library. Jsx is helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside of the JavaScript code. It allows react to show more useful error messages and warnings.

React elements are immutable.
With Tailwind, you style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML.

But using utility classes has a few important advantages over inline styles:

Designing with constraints. Using inline styles, every value is a magic number. With utilities, you’re choosing styles from a predefined design system, which makes it much easier to build visually consistent UIs.
Responsive design. You can’t use media queries in inline styles, but you can use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to build fully responsive interfaces easily.
Hover, focus, and other states. Inline styles can’t target states like hover or focus, but Tailwind’s state variants make it easy to style those states with utility classes.
