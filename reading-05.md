Linked lists use nodes to store data points. These lists can be singly linked or doubly linked. A singly linked list is a Linked list taht only has the data flow in  one direction. 
A doubly linked list allows you to access the data from both directions. This allows you to see the nodes previous in the list. Normally you only have access to the next node.

The Head of a linked list is the first value of a list much like the head of a snake. You have to traverse a Linked list either iteratively or recursively. It is not possible to traverse a linked list by referencing a given node on command.
